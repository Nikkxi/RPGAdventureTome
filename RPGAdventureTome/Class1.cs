         * NOTES
         * 
         * Idea #1
         *      Use components to represent capabilities (de-coupling)
         * 
         * 
         * Idea #2
         *      Define your own type where each instance represents a type (TypeObject pattern)
         * 
         * 
         * Idea #3
         *      When in doubt, try turning an operation into an object (Command Pattern)
